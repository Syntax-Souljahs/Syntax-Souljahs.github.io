## Community feedback

Here is some feedback from individuals in the community who have accessed the app

"Very interactive homepage, looks very professional, the app has a lot of potential, I can see me and my friends use it a bunch to interact with people. Maybe fix up the interface on an Iphone but other than that it looks like the app could be a big hit. Almost like a facebook but for the gym"- Shaira Jalalon



" I really liked the concept for your webpage. A match maker for lifting is a great idea, that I think would get a lot of use. I have a couple thoughts and ideas to share. The layout of the website was simple and easy to navigate on computer, but on mobile the text often overlapped, and the boxes were sized really awkwardly. Not sure if you intend for mobile use, but I feel like that’s where it would be the most popular. Saying somewhere on the homepage, “intended for desktop use” would probably be best. The fonts were readable except for the title page or the “welcome back ___” page. The dark color of the font with a white highlight around the outside was really harsh on the eyes. This is a big one, have some more social interaction on the platform. Maybe display my workout schedule for the week on my profile for my friends to see. Also, I could help but notice there wasn’t a friends list type of thing to see my current workout buddies. For future expansion, maybe a streak system where you can level up your relationship with your gym buddies by working out together. The third idea is a “for the future” type of idea. If this were to be developed further into the future, and you wanted to make a business out of it, I think you probably could do it." - Ashton Ka'ahanui-Isaacson
